##### Connected - A Weather Based React App

Welcome to Connected. Connected is a weather based React App that is a small space on the internet to feel more connected with all parts of the world, both now and in the past.

Connected allows you to search for the current weather anywhere in the world, as well as looking at historical weather forecast data anywhere in the world.

##### Motivation

The idea behind Connected was to have a simple space on the internet to feel connected to other parts of the world through the weather. I have always enjoyed Meteorology from a young age, at one point wanting to be a Meteorologist along the way.

The goal was to have an easy UI/UX when interacting with the Connected App.

##### Build Status

Connected App is currently on v1.1 - the latest update being changing the weather API used for the current weather search to be the same weather API used when looking up the historical weather. This API proved to be easier to work with, and the data that can be obtained is more extensive making a more end-user experience.
