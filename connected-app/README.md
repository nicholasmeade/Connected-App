##### Connected - A Weather Based React App

Welcome to Connected. Connected is a weather based React App that is a small space on the internet to feel more connected with all parts of the world, both now and in the past.

Connected allows you to search for the current weather anywhere in the world, as well as looking at historical weather forecast data anywhere in the world.

##### Motivation

The idea behind Connected was to have a simple space on the internet to feel connected to other parts of the world through the weather. I have always enjoyed Meteorology from a young age, at one point wanting to be a Meteorologist along the way.

The goal was to have an easy UI/UX when interacting with the Connected App.

##### Build Status

Connected App is currently on v1.1 - the latest update being changing the weather API used for the current weather search to be the same weather API used when looking up the historical weather. This API proved to be easier to work with, and the data that can be obtained is more extensive making a more enjoyable end-user experience.

##### Framework Used

Connected App is built with [React](https://reactjs.org/).

Supporting technologies used includes Javascript, HTML and CSS.

##### API Reference

Connected App utilizies the [Weather API](https://www.weatherapi.com/). There are different pricing tiers for Weather API. Connected App utilizes the free pricing tier.

##### How to use Connected App

The landing page is the Current Weather section. It greets the user with a dynamic greeting based upon their local date and time. The greeting changes between 'Good Morning!', 'Good afternoon!' and 'Good Evening!'. A concise description of Connected is at the center of the screen, with incentivizing user interaction to search for the current weather anywhere in the world. The input placeholder directs the user on what to search for.

Upon a successful search, it grabs the location and displays info of current temperature, the feels-like temperature, and the current weather condition. The [Weather API](https://www.weatherapi.com/) icons obtained from the API call is used for a more interactive experience. A call to action is included to incentivize the user to navigate to the Historical Weather section to search for weather in the past.

You can search for the historical weather on the Historical Weather section. You can search by zip code, town, state or country. The API limitation is a maximum look-back of 7 days. A paid subscription to the API will allow for a further look back capability, with the highest offering for this specific API of weather data since 2010. A dynamic user-specific instruction is generated by utilizing the user's current date, and directly showing the furthest possible date they can search.

Upon a successful search, it grabs the location and displays info of what the forecast was on the day selected by the user. The API call for a historical call is more extensive than the current forecast API call in Current Weather. Data is structured to have a more immersive experience for the user to see what weather conditions they would have experienced at 12PM, at that location, on the day searched.
