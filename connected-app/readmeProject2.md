# ![](https://ga-dash.s3.amazonaws.com/production/assets/logo-9f88ae6c9c3871690e33280fcf557f33.png) Project 2: React
#### Overview

Let's kick it up a notch and build a modular and modern front end application using React!

Like with project one, the Unit 2 project is a chance to be creative and build something you should be proud of. You will be working individually for this project.  Show us what you've got!

## Prerequistes

In order to help set you up for success you are required to do the following before you attempt to plan out your project:

#### Reading

 The [previous cohorts project retrospective](previous-class-project-retrospective.md)

There are alot of helpful hints and hindsight that were captured after the completion of project 2 which are sure to help provide some guidance on what to and not to do during this project. 

#### Watch

 [Mastering Markdown](https://masteringmarkdown.com/) - 34min

 You will need to write and update markdown for this project as will be the case for all future projects so it's your responsibility to become familiar with the syntax.

## Requirements

#### Your website must:
- Be a working, interactive, React application.
- Include data from a third-party API.
    - TRY OUT your API in the browser by making an fetch request before you get too emotionally invested in it, to make sure it works the way you think it does...**YOU ARE REQUIRED TO SHOW US YOU CAN RECEIVE THE DATA FOR YOUR PROPOSAL**
- Include React Router with at least 2 routes
- Have at least 5 separate components, using a readable file structure.
- Be built using Create React App.
- Built mobile first 
- Implement responsive design using flexbox, grid, or another css framework.
- Use React Hooks
- Be deployed on github pages https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages (we will go over this together)

### ðŸ“‹ List of API's

 Pull data into the application using an API  
  - [List of Public APIs](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis)  
  - [More APIs](https://github.com/abhishekbanthia/Public-APIs)  

Below is a non-exhaustive list of some free API's you can use. There are _many_ API's out there, however, so if you find one not on this list that you'd like to use, feel free! Please note that some may require signing up for an API key (e.g. the Marvel API).

  1. Marvel: https://developer.marvel.com/
  1. Star Wars: https://swapi.co/
  1. Weather: https://openweathermap.org/api
  1. News: https://newsapi.org/
  1. Giphy: https://developers.giphy.com/

Lastly, the following sites congregates a bunch of API's together, so you can take a look through their libraries and try to find an API that interests you! Note, however, that not all API's are free and many listed may require payment. We **highly suggest** to use a free API for your first project dealing with one.

## Necessary Deliverables

#### Commits

#### A Professional README
- Refer to this [blog](https://medium.com/@meakaakka/a-beginners-guide-to-writing-a-kickass-readme-7ac01da88ab3) as a great resource on how to create a readme.

#### A Completed Project Proposal:
- Refer to the [project worksheet](/project-worksheet.md) file in this repo for structuring your Proposal.

#### For the project:
- A git repository hosted on GitHub, with a link to your hosted project, and **frequent** commits dating back to the very beginning of the project (YOUR APP SHOULD BE LOCATED IN A SEPARATE STANDING REPO. DO NOT build your app in this repository. YOU MUST initiate a new repo on your GitHub account.)
